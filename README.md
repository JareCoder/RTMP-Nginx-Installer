# RTMP-Nginx-Installer - WIP

## This script still heavily work in progress. Full logic is not yet fully functional. This repo is public for easy testing purposes!

A bash script to install a newer version of Nginx with the RTMP addon included.

After having to hassle around building from source I got inspired to create this script to ease the workflow of installing and configuring the famous Nginx RTMP Server module with a single git clone.
